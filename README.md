# Premier-League20-21-Analysis

This repo is an exercise developed in Python which refers to the analysis of the Premier League 2020/21 football season. This was my first data analysis and I tried to extract the data referring to the best goalscorers, best assist man, the average age of the teams, etc.
the working method was to acquire the data, extrapolate them, normalize them and finally provide for the Data Visualization.
This exercise was performed using Jupyter Notebook and using the main Python libraries, namely Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib
